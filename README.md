## Phase 1 — Data Preparation ✅

This phase focuses on generating a simulated dataset for a carbon-aware cloud workload scheduling system.

### Dataset Features
- Hourly timestamps for 90 days
- Simulated cloud workload demand
- Carbon intensity variation (gCO2/kWh)
- Realistic daily and weekly patterns

### Output
data/carbon_aware_workload_dataset.csv

### Purpose
The dataset will be used in the next phase for machine learning based workload forecasting and carbon-aware scheduling optimization.
